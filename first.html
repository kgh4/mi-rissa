    <h1>)the first one,just like how you are ,the first in my heart(cringe but enjoy) </h1>
    
    <p>
  HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY BEAUTIFUL RISSA,today is a very special day to me and to everyone ,i think humanity has been blessed with your existence here,i mean
 ..in a world full of ungratefulness,mistreatment,in al of this chaos of a rogue,very cold world,you were there,with your beautiful energy,radiating wherever you go,like a shiny star ,heck,a whole nebula,and suddenly ,i start to doubt
my knowledge about science and astronomy,since they mentioned that if a star were to be close to the earth,we would burn instantly,don't they know about you?..
okay enough with the flattering now,let me give my speech..
september 22nd is not a usual day ,and i think your parents might back me up on this ,not only mrs carol because that was when she got rid of all the pregnancy pain,but because she ,maybe for the first time,saw what all that bearing
,doctor visits,shots was finally worth it,maybe she saw you through sonography before,but im sure nothing could ever be as great as holding your child in your arms,and if you ask me,im jealous of her ,at least she got to hold you in her arms..
here i am,eighteen years later,having the same wish ,just to hold you on that very same day,and tell you that nothing could ever replace your presence,not even the stars in the darkest nights..
i find it ironic on how you changed my whole perspective about birthdays,before i met you,i thought it's just an event,you know..just one more candle on top of the cake,but that changed within the first two weeks of talking to you,we
were just talking and i felt myself slowly liking you,then came your birthday,so i started to think about things from another point of view .."so you are telling me,14 years ago,this pretty girl was born ,just for me to meet her 14 years
later,ya allah,thank you for giving her everything she needed to reach me ,everything,from her kind soul,to her loving personality,her calm yet beautiful way of talking,her brain (although she doesn't have much of that),everything that
can only make more than just words,everything that has me thinking of birthdays as a remarkable event ,a chance to remind you of how good you are,although i think you shouldn't be celebrated every year,i think you should be celebrated
every second of every minute of every hour of every day.
and today i say it proudly,it hasn't only been 18 years that you honored this earth with your presence,but also 4 years and two weeks that you lit up my whole world ,so on this occasion i want to remind you of everything you have been through*
either i was there or wasn't there to witness it ,maybe i haven't seen all what you have been through for the past 18 years,but from the result,all i can say is how grateful i am for the accumulation of these adventures,especially the ones
i shared with you,and im looking forward for so much more of ones like these.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY ONCE AGAIN MY BEAUTIFUL RISSA ,MAY ALLAH KEEP YOUR HEALTH AND KEEP MY BLESSING (YOU)
