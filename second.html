    <h1>you jumped to the fourth?,wow,alright birthday girl (kinda emotional)</h1>
    
    <p>
    HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY BEAUTIFUL RRIISSSAA,
wow,18 years of age,i knew you since you were 14,wow,you looked so much younger back then,your hairstyles were different..i still remember these days as if they were yesterday,i still remember you recommending songs to me wherever i'm 
about to go to sleep,i still remember the first song was "for me,it's you" by lo moon,i still remember how you dressed back then ,your pink floyd t-shirt,i still remember the first snap you ever sent me,i still remember all the dresses 
you bought,please..how could i forget that,and even if i do forget some of them,the shape of your body remains engraved in my mind ,i mean for me,they are just clothes,until YOU put them on ..
I still remember the first time i heard your voice,i still remember our first call, i still remember the quarantine we spent together,i still remember you hyping me up whenever i get home from the gym,i still remember sending you snaps 
from my old room, i still remember the books you read,that perfume you bought for me,as if having you wasn't enough of a gift..
i still remember playing fortnite with you, i still remember all the late nights i stayed with you,all the paragraphs you wrote,the edits you made (you have inspired me to give editing a try),just like how you inspire me to do a lot of 
things,i mean heck,at times you even inspired me to get out of bed ,you have been a source of joy and a lucky charm ever since you came into my life.
I remember on my bac year,i treated you like you would never be 18,unaware that i was just one year away,and it feels surreal,you know,when i was watching that livestream of your school,and you came on the screen and i heard your name,
i felt like i was dreaming ,so much that i had to pinch myself,i also shed a tear or two(i sobbed..but its probably because of the pinch,not you...).
look at you now,new horizons,never failing to make me and your parents proud,and im sure they are as blessed as i am,i mean look at you,i would trade everything for a daughter like you,and i would do it in a heartbeat.
Now i know it's not all rainbows and butterflies,and you have had your share of trouble and misfortune,but you,you rose up from it,like how the whale reaches the surface from hundreds of feet below.
if i'm being brutally honest,one of the many things im very glad about is witnessing every phase and obstacle you ever face,and watching you own it,which can only make me feel so proud,like i did 4 years ago,and like i still do till this
day,together,we have shared a lot of hardships ,whether be it arguments,fights,mood swings,and a ton of differences,but i can't help but be proud for what we have faced and be proud of myself for finding a true gem like you,just know
rissa,you are,was ,and will always be like that to me,and so much more...
SO I WISH YOU A PERFECT BIRTHDAY MY RISSA,AS PERFECT AS YOU,AND I PRAY TO ALLAH THAT YOU NEVER STOP GROWING,AND THAT HE HONORS ME TO BE THE WITNESS TO THIS GROWTH
    </p>
