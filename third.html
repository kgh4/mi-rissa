    <h1>you jumped to the fourth?,wow,alright birthday girl (kinda emotional)</h1>
    
    <p>
    HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY BEAUTIFUL WIIIISSAA,
i know you are in the philippines now,and so i want to use this as a reminder,since you were born on that land,let's take some time to appreciate that all the beauty of the philippine's beaches,beautiful tall mountains,and vast beautiful
was abridged in one person and one person only,and that is you,your beauty goes beyond any physical limitations,and that was the first thing i ever noticed ,first and foremost ,you have a very pure and beautiful soul,one that is so pure
that i can't help but admire it ,i have known that ever since the first time you opened your mouth,i knew that you were nothing ordinary,maybe its the "extraordinary" connection that we share,maybe it's how beautiful you always are in my
eyes or maybe it's just how good you look,heck ,i can't even explain it,no matter how fast my fingers were on that damn thing,no matter how many times in a second your picture is repeated inside my head,or how much i think of you.
i don't know what i should do exactly or even what i did to deserve you, i don't know who i should thank for having you,and so,and since you are the one reading this,i want tot say wholeheartedly,thank you,thank you first of all for existing
thank you for putting up with me,thank you for all the time you invested in me and yourself,thank you for never giving up ,thank you for being my faith in days when i felt like i couldn't even believe myself,thank you for being the sheler
from this cold cruel world,thank you for being there whenever i needed ,thank you for making all the difficulties i face look funny and making every success i make so big that sometimes i feel like i really made a huge impact,that's how much 
power you have over me,that's how much a word or two from you can change it all for me ,and yes,i want to be like that too with you,and maybe now is the time to tell you how proud i am of you,you are 18,just turned legal ,that doesn't 
only mean no jail time for me ,but it means that you now are a woman,legally,welcome to adulthood,although you have been a very strong girl since the day i knew you,and you took responsabilities that no other girl your age would take,
and though you were put against some really difficult challenges ,,so goddamn the law,i don't need the law to crown my girl,she has been a big girl since day one .
wow rissa,everything coming together,driver's license ,rissa here ,rissa there,graduation ,debut ,and i can't help but be proud and stand here ,clapping for you with every bit of force i have in me ,becuase you had and you will always 
have my head up high ,and i know challenges wont stop or slow down,but i will be sure to be here just to see you turn these obstacles into milestones.
AND I WILL ALWAYS BE BY YOUR SIDE ,MY BEAUTIFUL FLOWER GIRL.
    </p>
