    <h1>you jumped to the fourth?,wow,alright birthday girl (kinda emotional)</h1>
    
    <p>
    sometimes ..it becomes unbearable ...knowing that you are on the other side of this screen ,without me being able to touch you,hold you..and feel you with me,although we talk everyday..all day,but it doesn't really bother me ,since everytthing 
	i do ,i do it as if you were here ,from putting my clothes on to making my coffee to talking and smiling ,and ..when i do all of this,it feels as if you were here ,facing me ,with your lips opening as you smile ,or your eyes rolling
	whenever i say something stupid ,or the face you give me whenever i start bullying you,and the way you cross your hands ,and although it is annoying that i can't hold you close and kiss you while you're mad ,and i can't touch your 
	beautiful hair whenever i see it,and you can't look at me with those small eyes whenever you are mad ,but..i think about it all the time ,everytime,and suddenly ,i'm not alone anymore ,she's here ,with her breathtaking charm,
	her innocence and her puerile faces 
so from my place,8000 miles away from you,please ,don't you ever stop doing that,i have always loved and i will always love every version you have (yes ,including grumpy rissa)
and with this i finish the fourth and last paragraph,just know,though they do finish here,my love and appreciation for you will never stop..
    </p>
